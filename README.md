# Data Compression Algorithms
## Description
This repository contains the implementation of an application (_**CompressifyPro**_) that contains the following data compression algorithms: 
#### LosslessTechnique:
- Standard-Huffman Coding
- LZ77
- LZW
#### LossyTechnique:
- Vector Quantization
- 2D Predictive Coding
## Features
- This application takes a text file or an image as an input and compresses/decompresses it using one of the above algorithms.
## Tools used
- **_IntelliJ IDEA_**: an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing software written in Java and other languages.
- **_Java Swing_**: a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUIScreen) widget toolkit that includes a rich set of widgets.
